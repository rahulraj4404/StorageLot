StorageLot

 
 You are store owner ,you have an empty space of m x n which is of a rectangular space.
 customers can store thier item/things(m x n) in your empty space ,for that you charge per day for keeping it for x no of days.
 you can accept the box  or you can reject the box based on your available space, noofdays and maximum profit you can make.
 you have last 30 days data available to you.
 now write two functions 1)whether you accept the box or not
                         2)totalprofit made
it should be a class oriented approach ,you can use helper functions as well


approach - try to check the available space to keep the box and  calculate the profit that it can make by storing it for x no of days,  from last 30 days data  calculate profit per day earned (also how much can it make for x noofdays)  and now  check if profit of box is greater than or equal to the profit(last 30 days) then I accept the box
